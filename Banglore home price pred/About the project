This is an end-to-end project involving a backend and a frontend UI. The project is about predicting apartment prices in banglore that too area specific. 
Features of the model:
1. Total sqtft area
2. No. of bathrooms
3. No. of bedrooms
4. The locality of apartment

I have used Linear Regression for the prediction and dataset bengaluru_house_prices.csv. The directory also contains a pickle file for the model that was trained in Jupyter notebook after data cleaning.
